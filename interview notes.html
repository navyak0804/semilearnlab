    <h1>Interview Questions:</h1>
    <br>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>What would you say the difficulty of your AP Science class is on a scale of 1-10 and why?</li><br>
        <li>How do you find quality resources for your AP science classes?</li><br>
        <li>What do you classify as a quality resource to study?</li><br>
        <li>What type of resources keep you engaged in learning?</li><br>
        <li>Are you aware of your learning style? If so, what learning style suits you best? (visual, auditory, read/write, kinesthetic)</li><br>
        <li>Tell me about some of the pros and cons of your teacher’s teaching style.</li><br>
        <li>How often do you study for each AP science class? Does each learning session last for a long or short time? If long, why do you feel like it takes you that much time?</li><br>
        <li>Does finding resources take part of your studying time?</li><br>
        <li>Name some of the resources that you use to study for (AP science) class. What are the pros and cons of those resources that you’ve experienced?</li><br>
        <li>How motivated are you to learn and study for your AP science classes? Based on your response, why are you motivated/not motivated to study?</li><br>
        <li>Did you use any AP-specific prep materials (Princeton Review, Barron’s)? How helpful were they to other resources? What is your favorite prep material?</li><br>
        <li>Do you think these AP prep materials are good for studying or just for review?</li><br>
        <li>How do you feel about a streak system, like Duolingo, to keep you motivated to study?</li><br>
        <li>What additional resources do you wish existed for AP science classes that you haven’t found?</li><br>
        <li>What are some things that you look for in a studying platform/database?</li><br>
      </ol>

      <h1>Interview Feeback:</h1>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
          <br>
          <li>Quality resources are characterized by the inclusion of questions, answers, and detailed explanations. Such materials engage students by providing comprehensive practice and clear explanations all in one place.</li>
          <br>
          <li>All interviewed students were aware of their learning styles, with the majority identifying as read/write and visual learners.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Many students requested quizzes that not only provide the correct answers but also explain why the other options are incorrect.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Some students reported that sourcing study materials does not take much time as they rely on teacher-provided resources. However, those who seek additional materials spend considerable time finding the most helpful resources.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Study time for AP Science classes varies, typically ranging from 30 minutes to 1 hour daily or 3 to 5 hours before major tests.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>At the beginning of the year, students have not extensively used AP prep materials like Barron's or Princeton Review, although they find these resources useful for review rather than initial learning.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Students are generally motivated to study for their AP Science classes, driven by a desire to perform well irrespective of the difficulty of the content.
          </li>
